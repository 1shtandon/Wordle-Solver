It generates a file containing a list of all five-letters words that are needed to solve the puzzle.
Following three operations can be performed to filter out the words as per the corresponding guess:
- Update by letters : Takes letters as input that occur in the word.
- Update by index : Takes the letter and its index as the input and filter out the list. 
- Remove by letters : Takes letters as input that does not occur in the word,

And.....  ✨Magic ✨    happens   !!!

The list helps you to take the best guess.
